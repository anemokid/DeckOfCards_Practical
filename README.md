# DeckOfCards_Practical
An app with one activity that allows a user to draw from a shuffled deck. Once cards are drawn, they will be added to a RecyclerView so that the user can see them.  At any time the user can start over with a brand new shuffled deck of playing cards. 

what worked well:
- Loading image views in the adapter 
- Networking for the shuffled deck id  
- user validation

what was difficult: 
- working on my retrofit calls to return a list of cards 
- one of the user validation checks is incorrect
